**Unchanged Problems**:

**Major Fraud Detection**: Shadan A.'s "Adaptive Allocation Trend Strategy" claiming **+27.18% return** with **100% BTC win rate** has been **disqualified** after comprehensive fraud analysis revealed critical overfitting violations:

**Evidence of Hindsight Bias**:
- **Impossible Statistics**: 100% win rate over 45 BTC trades in highly volatile crypto market
- **Perfect Market Timing**: Monthly rebalancing strategy "accidentally" exits before every market crash
- **Statistical Impossibility**: 5 consecutive profitable monthly exits (probability <3%)
- **Overfitting Pattern**: Strategy optimized specifically for Jan-Jun 2024 data period

**Technical Analysis**:
- ✅ Code integrity verified (no malicious code)
- ✅ Platform compliance confirmed
- ✅ Yahoo Finance data usage validated
- ❌ **Results exhibit systematic hindsight bias**

**Fraud Classification**: Overfitting/Hindsight Bias - Strategy designed with future knowledge of market movements, making results unreproducible in live trading environments.

**Contest Impact**: This specific strategy and submission have been invalidated due to violation of fair competition principles. Results would be impossible to achieve in real trading conditions.

**Status**: ❌ **STRATEGY DISQUALIFIED** - This entry is void. Participant may submit alternative strategies following contest guidelines.

### 🚨 **SUBMISSION REJECTED: Harsh T. (tanyat29) - Data Verification Failure**

**Major Disqualification**: Harsh T.'s submission claiming **+38.83% return** has been **rejected** after comprehensive audit revealed critical compliance violations:

**Verification Failures**:
- **Missing Data Files**: Referenced `ETH_USD_2024-01-01_2024-06-30_1h.csv` not provided
- **Reproducibility Failure**: Backtest returns `FileNotFoundError` - impossible to verify claims

**Status**: ❌ **PERMANENTLY REJECTED** - Contest integrity maintained through rigorous verification process.

### 🚨 **SUBMISSION REJECTED: Abdul L. (masory74) - Strategy Misrepresentation**

**Major Fraud Detection**: Abdul L.'s submission claiming **+43.36% average return** has been **rejected** after detailed audit revealed critical strategy misrepresentation:

**Documentation Fraud**:
- **Claimed Strategy**: "Momentum + Volatility-Adjusted Hybrid" with moving averages and trend analysis
- **Actual Implementation**: Simple Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy
- **Missing Components**: No moving average calculations, no trend_strength computations, no claimed volatility adjustments

**Technical Violations**:
- Strategy documentation completely misrepresents actual code implementation
- Performance claims based on undisclosed DCA approach, not claimed momentum strategy
- CSV data format issues with malformed headers and volume data inclusion

**Status**: ❌ **PERMANENTLY REJECTED** - Strategy misrepresentation violates contest transparency requirements.

### 🔄 **RESUBMISSION REJECTED: Saniya (SaniyaSuria) - Persistent Framework Violations**

**Third Rejection**: Saniya's resubmission continues to violate core framework requirements despite previous feedback:

**Persistent Issues**:
- **API Incompatibility**: Still uses `generate_signal(symbol, data)` instead of required `generate_signal(market, portfolio)`
- **Framework Integration**: Custom runner and BaseStrategy implementation incompatible with contest platform
- **Execution Failure**: ModuleNotFoundError prevents backtest execution

**Status**: ❌ **PERMANENTLY REJECTED** - No further resubmissions accepted due to repeated violations.

## 📅 **November 9, 2025** - *13 Days Until Contest End*

### 🏆 **NEW 2ND PLACE: Edudzi A Achieves +26.70% Return**

**Major Leaderboard Update**: Edudzi A's final submission (3/3) has secured **2nd place** with an impressive +26.70% combined return using a sophisticated buy-and-hold maximizer strategy!

**Performance Highlights**:
- **BTC**: +26.41% with 12.55% max drawdown
- **ETH**: +27.00% with 17.02% max drawdown
- **Strategy**: Buy-and-hold with 55% position sizing
- **Win Rate**: 97.5% across 36 trades

**Verification Status**: Passed all security, compliance, and fraud detection checks. Container deployed and live trading confirmed.

### 🚨 **Framework Incompatibilities Continue**

**Abu B. Submission Rejected**: Strategy using incompatible `on_bar()` API instead of required `generate_signal()` method. Despite sound logic (EMA+RSI+ATR approach), submission used placeholder data and cannot integrate with contest framework.

**Impact**: Disqualification rate now **approaching 30%** due to platform compatibility issues - technical compliance remains as critical as performance!

### 🔧 **Abu B. Resubmission Update**

**Partial Progress**: Abu B. submitted revised strategy addressing previous feedback. While improvements noted (yfinance integration, proper methods), **critical API incompatibility remains**. Strategy still uses `generate_signal(bar)` instead of required `generate_signal(market, portfolio)` signature.

**Status**: Still rejected - framework integration incomplete despite 40% progress toward compliance.

### 🔄 **Saniya Resubmission Rejected**

**Same Pattern Repeats**: Saniya's revised strategy confirms previous platform compatibility warnings. Despite clean mean reversion logic, submission uses `generate_signal(symbol, data)` API and custom BacktestExchange instead of required Yahoo Finance data. **Framework incompatibility persists** - complete rewrite needed for contest integration.
