**Verification Status**: Passed all security, compliance, and fraud detection checks. Container deployed and live trading confirmed.

### 🚨 **Framework Incompatibilities Continue**

**Abu B. Submission Rejected**: Strategy using incompatible `on_bar()` API instead of required `generate_signal()` method. Despite sound logic (EMA+RSI+ATR approach), submission used placeholder data and cannot integrate with contest framework.

**Impact**: Disqualification rate now **approaching 30%** due to platform compatibility issues - technical compliance remains as critical as performance!
